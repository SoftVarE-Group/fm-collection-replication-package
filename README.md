# Replication Package for Literature Survey on Empirical Evaluations in Feature-Model Analysis

This repository contains sheets indicating the decisions for including or excluding publications for the literature set.
In particular, for each excluded publications the sheet includes at least one violation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
